# Ethical Considerations & Deployment

## Ethical Framework

### Privacy-First Design Principles

#### 1. Data Minimization

- **Data Retention**: Minimal data retention (5-second windows, then discarded)
- **Access Control**: Restricted access to network monitoring capabilities

### Compliance Framework

#### GDPR Compliance
- **Lawful Basis**: Legitimate interest in network optimization and user experience
- **Data Subject Rights**: Right to access, rectify, and delete personal data
