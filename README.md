# Samsung EnnovateX 2025 AI Challenge Submission

- **Problem Statement** - *Real-time Detection of Reel Traffic vs Non-reel Traffic in a Social-networking Application-

SNS applications (such as Facebook and YouTube), transmit both video (short videos, reels, etc.) and non-video traffic (feeds, suggestions, etc.) through the same data pipeline. Develop an AI model to differentiate reel / video traffic versus non-reel/video traffic in real-time, enabling user equipment (UE) to optimize performance dynamically. The model should also ensure accuracy under varying network congestion and coverage conditions.*
